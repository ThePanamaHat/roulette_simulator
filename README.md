# roulette_simulator
This program will use Monte Carlo simulation to provide statistics and probability for potential winnings and losses during a roulette game, based on user inputted data. 

Install requirements, then run program with Python3.

This program is for educational purposes only and there are no guarantees or warranties included or implied. If you actually gamble, you do so at your own risk. 

This program will give you statistical analysis in order to inform a hypothetical roulette player of the probability of achieving a certain level of profit in a roulette game based on the following inputs:
- Starting cash 
- Bet amount (money bet per spin)
- Hours per day player is willing to gamble
- Days player is willing to gamble

The simulation will run X times depending on if the user wants fast, normal, or slow results. The slower the choice, the more simulations are run, and the more accurate the data is. Currently, the simulation options are for 1000 (fast), 3000 (medium), & 10000 (slow) simulations.

Currently, there is only an option to bet on a number. Other options present in roulette, such as betting on black/red, are not available, but may be available in future updates.

There are several bugs currently, such as the program crashing with improper user inputs. These are being worked on, but this is the least viable product.
